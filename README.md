# Automatic Dog Door
#### Student Name: *Tom√°s McGrath*   Student ID: *20103551*

I did a dog door sensor, it scans for motion and then records the light value and timestamps and sends it to azure , it processses and should come back from functionapp with a response to turn relay on or off.
I broke it at the end by accident when I added a timestamp value to the json.
Relay was supposed to simulate light coming on when its dark so a better photo could be taken.
Camera takes a picture and sends it to custom vision , if chance is greater than 40 that its a dog then turn on motor to simulate opening door. 
After a while door closes.
I have blynk displaying light values, I have a blob for the timestamp and light value and then I plot them.

Here was the code for my function app, it didn't work in the end after I added a timestamp and I wasn't able to fix it.
Checks if light value is greater than 100 and if not turns on the relay with a message response.

code for handling response, no longer works.

main code loop that runs when motion is detected. reads the light value and sends it as telemtry with a timestamp.

code to display values in blynk.
Predictions check there probabilty and set the servor motor angle to open.
After a while if no motion detected it closes.
