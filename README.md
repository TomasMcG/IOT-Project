### IOT-Project

i am planning on doing a project that detects for a dog and opens a dog door. I might also have it send you a notification. I would use motion sensor and camera for input, have a light and a relay for output. I would use a motion detector for motion, if yes then checks if its dark and turns on light. I will take a picture with the camera and send it to vision to check if its a dog. I will train a dog detections model. I might try to host it with a container. Azure wull manage the mqtt for me. If it is a dog then it will turn ona relay to let the dog go inside and then turn off the relay after a set amount of time of no dog. I might also try to use blynk to access the camera at anytime but that would be an extra thing. I need to learn how to use the motion detector first.
